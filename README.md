# NumGI - Differential Equation Solver using Transformer-based AI
NumGI is an open-source project that aims to solve differential equations using transformer-based AI models. It provides a user-friendly interface for solving a wide range of ordinary and partial differential equations.

# Features
Solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs).
Support for a variety of boundary conditions and initial conditions.
Interactive visualization of solutions.
Ability to handle both linear and nonlinear differential equations.
Ability to solve systems of differential equations.

# Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/arnaudbergeron/NumGI.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd NumGI

# Usage
Launch the NumGI application by running numgi.py.

Enter the differential equation you want to solve in the provided input field.

Specify the initial conditions or boundary conditions, if required.

Click the "Solve" button to obtain the solution.

The solution will be displayed in a graph, and additional details will be provided in the console.

You can experiment with different equations and conditions by modifying the input fields.
